transformers is not working now with the machine as it is.

need to avoid having to use version 3.5.1 of transformers; the dataset loaders are rubbish.

I maybe still need this:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/conda/lib

also fix the whole libcudart thing. for reference:

mkdir -p /usr/local/nvidia/lib/

ln -s /opt/conda/lib/libcudart.so.11.0  /usr/local/nvidia/lib/libcudart.so.10.1
